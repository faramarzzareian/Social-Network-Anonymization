# Network Analysis Code

This repository contains code for analyzing networks using the NetworkX library. The code includes functions for generating graphs, perturbing graphs, calculating graph properties, and visualizing graphs.
## Requirements

    Python 3.x
    NetworkX
    Pandas
    Matplotlib
    Statistics

## Usage

The code consists of several functions, including:

    vertex_ref: computes the degree of vertices in a graph for a given depth.
    all_neighbours: calculates the neighbors of a vertex in the graph.
    edge_facts_subgraph: computes subgraphs based on edge information.
    all_subgraphs: generates all subgraphs from a starting node.
    read_graph: reads a graph from an edge list file.
    create_scale_free_graph: creates a scale-free graph with a specified number of nodes.
    draw_graph: generates a visual representation of a graph using the specified layout.
    giant_comp: calculates the giant component of a graph.
    get_measurements: calculates various properties of a graph, including number of nodes, edges, diameter, betweenness, clustering, components, and closeness.
    perturbation: generates a perturbed version of the original graph by removing edges.
